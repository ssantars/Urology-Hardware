This is the version 1 for schematics and board layout. This version was unfortuately very buggy and required wet wiring to fix issues. 
Issues that plagued this project was the entire battery management system needed lines cut and reappended due to mistakes and 
misunderstandings when making schematics. In addition, to flashing code we had to fabricate a pull down for the TX line and reverse both the
TX and RX lines on the FT232R in order to make ESP32 flashable. Finally, the size of the two boards made the case unable to close. 

Great starting point, but more work and revisions will be made in Urology v2.6.
